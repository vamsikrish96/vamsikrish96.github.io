        <li>Implemented Support Vector Machines, Naïve Bayes and Decision trees using Enron email dataset.</li>
        <li>Generated predictions by classifying the emails based on the author.</li>
        <li> Performed comparative studies through juxtaposition of training time, data-fitting and prediction metrics.</li>
     </ul>
    
    <h5>Design of a delay-efficient FIR filter using Wallace tree multiplier | ModelSim, Xilinx ISE</h5>
     <ul>
        <li>Modified the architecture of baseline FIR filter using Wallace tree multiplier and multiple constant multiplication
           techniques (MCM)</li>
        <li>The time complexity was reduced by an amount of 15.25% using the new architecture.</li>
